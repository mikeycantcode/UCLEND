# UCLEND - a P2P Loan Platform on the [EVM] blockchain

A cool loan project I thought of when I was learning about the way loans are handled in traditional finance

If you trust your counterparty and guarantor, this loan tool can make everything simplified and easy to use!

This is meant for loans where you know who your counterparty is and have legal agreements dealing with what would happen in the case of bad debt available

Anyways the workflow is kind of unintelligble right now but it will begin to make sense after I flesh out the idea a little more!

Happy lending!
